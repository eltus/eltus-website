        <h1>The history of GIF. (Credits to coding with lewis.)</h1>
        <p>GIF. A format that is used everywhere. GIF is a popular format that exist in phones, computers, laptop and
            tablets, and is normally opened using a web browser, or the Photos program that is built-in into Windows 10
            and 11. Here's the history behind GIF! In 1987 GIF was released and was used to download larger
            images and color. GIF89a spec was released on 1989, and was used to play multiple images at the same time.
            Like animation, but in a flip-book style and because of GIF89a spec. The web was revolutionized. (Okay, the
            rest of it are really complicated, so you might need to check the source where I find this. So the link of
            the original source is at the end of this project. So just click the link to the original source at the end
            of this project once you are finished reading, or just skip to end without reading the whole thing. But I
            will make it in simpler for me and you to understand.) Okay, so there's this compression algorithm thing,
            and all the compression algorithm thing are different and the compression algorithm of GIF is patented
