## part 3 how to install

1. from the earlier steps

2. from the earlier steps

3. once you have these extension installed then click the button that says: Go Live.
   here's the video for the button

4. https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website/assets/156885804/aa63e190-70e8-4d51-9521-3f8bd270bcd8

5. open your web browser and search localhost:5500

6. and open the eltus-website folder and open the index.html file

7. and there you go now you have eltus-website installed

Note: any changes that I make to eltus-website will result you to copy and paste the code again so keep an eye for any changes I have made

## Update: the video is now unavailable

## Update: here's the video for the Go Live button, and this is the only available video for the Go live button. And this video will also be on the newly added step 4 on "part 3 how to install" section.

https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website/assets/156885804/aa63e190-70e8-4d51-9521-3f8bd270bcd8

## Update: I have realized that you can just clone the repository, and if you don't know how to clone a repository follow these steps:

1. Open CMD.
2. And type "git clone" with the repository URL.

```
git clone
```

3. Then click enter.

And now you will have the repository on your system, and this repository is just a clone, so you can customize the cloned repository. Since it's not connected to the original repository. And also, here's the full "git clone" command:

```
git clone https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website
```

Copy this command and paste it to command prompt, or terminal, and click enter.

## Waring!: Please use this command on command prompt on a folder, or else the repository clone will be on the current user folder, on your users folder, or the system32 folder. Because that is the default folder when you open command prompt normally or as an administrator. So if you wanted to clone this repository, then open command prompt (A.K.A. CMD) on a folder, and here's how to open command prompt (A.K.A. CMD) on a folder.

1. Open the folder you wan't to clone the repository.
2. Go to the top of the folder and click the folder location, for example:

![Screenshot 2024-03-12 15-03-39](https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website/assets/156885804/79346e28-3631-4948-876f-145c2ee2e260)

In this example, my mouse is pointing at something and you need to follow it.

## Part 2:

3. Now click with your mouse.
4. Type in CMD.
5. And enter.

Now, this will open a command prompt window.

6. Copy the command on top of the warning.

Now, you have the repository on a folder you wanted, and not on your current user folder on your users folder, or the system32 folder.

## Update: here's how to install all the vscode extensions from part 3!

1. Open vscode or install vscode if you haven't
   installed vscode yet.
2. Look to the left sidebar of vscode
3. Click the 4 grouped squares icon (A.K.A. The extensions icon) or press Ctrl, Shift and X. (A.K.A. Ctrl+Shift+X).
4. Search for those 3 extensions from part 3.
5. Click on those 3 extensions.
6. Click the green "install" button.

## And now you have those 3 extensions installed. You can also, do this using the vscode extension marketplace website. Here's how you do it.

1. Open your web browser and search: "vscode extension marketplace". Click on the first link that appeared.
2. Do the previous step from "Update: here's how to install all the vscode extensions from part 3!". Above (step 4, or number 4).
3. Same with step 5 or number 5.
4. Same with step 6 or number 6.
5. Now once you have clicked the "install" button, the website will ask you to open the extension in VS Code. Click yes.
6. Repeat step 6 from the previous section.

And now you know how to install those 3 vscode extensions using the "vscode extension marketplace" website.

## Update: I have removed the old video link for the "Go live" button. The unavailable one and replaced it with the new video link for the Go live button. The available one.

## Update: my website is now on internet! To access my website. Click this link:

[Eltus website](https://eltus.github.io/eltus-website/)

## Update: I just realized that git must be installed in order for the, "git clone" command to work, so here are the steps on how to install git:

1. Open your browser and type this link, "https://git-scm.com/downloads", or just click this link: [Git download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Pick your OS for the installer file
3. Double click the EXE file
4. Customize the installation
5. Click the "install" button

Now you have Git installed on your computer

## I just realized that if you are new to vscode or programming, then you don't know how to use, and maybe don't know how to install vscode, so here are the steps!

1. Go to this link: [vscode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Pick your OS! (It's either Windows, macOS, or linux)
3. Run the installer file, or just double click the installer file
4. Customize the installation. (Not the entire installation)
5. Click the "install" button to install vscode
6. Open vscode, and open the cloned repository folder
7. Install all the recommended extensions

Now, you can customize the cloned repository in vscode.

## Update: I just realized that you can just use the browser version of vscode, so here it is:

1. [click this link](https://vscode.dev/)
2. Click on the button that says "Open folder"
3. The website will give you permissions on opening, and editing the folder, or file, so click "View files" (for opening a folder), and "Save changes" (for editing the folder)
4. Clone the repository, and open the folder in the browser version of vscode.

And now, you're be able to use vscode without installing it on to your computer. And learn more about the browser version of vscode by going to the [vscode web documentation.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web)

## Warning!: The browser version of vscode is still at preview, so there might be some bugs, and glitches in the browser version of vscode, so it's highly recommended installing vscode, but once the browser version of vscode has moved to it's full release, then you can use the browser version of vscode, but you can still use it ofc, but there might be some bugs, and glitches, but you can still use it, even though it's still in preview.

## Second Warning!: Some extensions might not support the browser version of vscode, so it is recommended to install vscode, or use extensions that support the browser version of vscode, but the recommended extensions does not support the browser version of vscode yet, so it is still recommended installing vscode, or just use the browser version of vscode without extensions.

## Update: the browser version of vscode now supports programming languages, for example, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Including emmet too! And prettier, GitLens, vscode-icons, and JavaScript (ES6) code snippets now support the browser version of vscode! Peacock, and Better Comments too!

## Update: download the batch/CMD, or PowerShell scripts if you want an easier method to clone the repository! Btw here's the downloads:

[Batch/CMD version](https://eltus.github.io/eltus-website/downloads/clone.bat) [PowerShell version](https://eltus.github.io/eltus-website/downloads/clone.ps1)

## Warning!: Please enable, "Ask where to save each file before downloading" option in Chrome settings download before downloading the Batch, or PowerShell scripts. Btw here's the link to the Chrome settings downloads:

[Chrome settings downloads](chrome://settings/downloads)

## Update: I just realized that the link to Chrome settings downloads doesn't work on websites, so just type in the link: chrome://settings/downloads in your browser, and turn on the setting that I just talked about.

## Update: I just realized that you can just right-click the PowerShell script, and select, "Run with PowerShell" option, then it will open PowerShell, but the script will run on PowerShell, but I still recommended the batch/CMD version because you can just double-click the script, then it will open a CMD window, but the script is running, and is way better than right-clicking on the PowerShell script, and selecting, "Run with PowerShell", but PowerShell is still being used as the default terminal in vscode, so PowerShell is good, and you can create PowerShell modules using .ps1 files, and when powered with the PowerShell vscode extension, you can create PowerShell modules faster, than without using the PowerShell vscode extension.

## Update: I have just turned on "Template repository" on my repository! Which means you can create a new repository, or codespace using the template from my repository! Which means it's just going to create a copy of the repository on your GitHub account, and you can create a new codespace using the repository template, and if you create a new repository, or codespace, then it will not be connected to the original repository.

## Update: It was, "Open in a new codespace", not creating a new codespace. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

## Update: If you don't know how to create a new repository using the template repository, then follow these steps:

1. Sign-in to your GitHub account, or create a new account
2. Search my repository on GitHub, or [click this link](https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website)
3. Click on the green button that says: "Use this template".
4. Click the: "Create a new repository" button
5. Create your repository.

And there you go! Now, you are be able to modify a copy of the repository!

## Update: You can also use codespaces, and publish the branch on to GitHub, and here's how to do it:

1. Click on the same button that I just talked about. (The green button that says: "Use this template").
2. Click on the: "Open in a new codespace" button
3. Once you have clicked on the button, then modify the repository as much as you like. (Like adding new files, folders, editing files, deleting files, deleting folders, and all of that)
4. Once you have modified the repository in the codespace, then click on the source control icon at the left sidebar. (Under the explorer icon, and search icon). For example:
   ![Source control](/images/source_control.png)
   In this example, my mouse is pointing at the source control icon, and you must click it.
5. Once you have clicked the source control icon, then click on the: "Publish branch" button, which publish the branch on to GitHub.

And now, you have a copy of the repository on GitHub! As well as the branches you have published.

## Update: When you are done installing vscode on to your computer, then click on the "Open folder" button, then select the cloned repository folder. (A.K.A the eltus-website folder, and the "Open folder" button is the same button from the browser version of vscode).

## Update: Here are all controls for accessing the activity bar/left sidebar, and more!

1. Accessing extensions: Ctrl+Shift+X
2. Opening a folder: Ctrl+O
3. Accesing source control: Ctrl+Shift+G

## Update: I will add more controls when I add new things from vscode to this. (Like search, explorer, and more).

## Update: Here are all the meanings of these words (you need to put your mouse cursor on the words with the underline to see the meanings of these words, and you must wait):

1. OFC = Of Course
2. TBH = To Be Honest
3. E.G. = Example

## Update: I will add more meanings when I have added new meanings on this page.

## Update: All the instructions about opening CMD, and all of that only works on Windows judging by the start menu icon that is in every single image including video(s)! So if you are on macOS or Linux, then follow these steps:

## Note: All of these instructions are just alternatives of the original instructions. (A.K.A the Windows version).

## macOS version:

1. On your macOS computer, open the terminal from Applications > Utilities.
2. On the terminal, type: "cd your/folder". And replace "your/folder" with your actual folder location/address
3. Type in the same command to clone the repository. (A.K.A git clone https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website).

## Linux version:

1. Use the built-in terminal app on Ubuntu, Debian, or Konsole on KDE.
2. In the terminal, type the cd command with your folder address (like from the macOS instructions)
3. Use the same command to clone the repository from the macOS instructions.

And there you go! Now you have my repository cloned on both Linux and macOS!

## I have just enabled releases on my website's GitHub repository! This means, you can download all versions of my website's source code, and all of the versions will be stored on a ZIP file, and make sure to extract the ZIP file in order to modify a new, or old version of my website, and upload it to GitHub by initializing the old, or new version of my website, and you need to use the: `git init` command. And this command initialize the new, or old version of my website, and if you want to upload the modified version of my website on to GitHub, then you will need a account on both Git, and GitHub, and to create an account on GitHub, just go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and click on the button that says: "sign up", or "sign in" if you already have a GitHub account, then fill in your password, email, and username, and you are done, now connect vscode with GitHub, so it will send the changes from vscode to GitHub, and to do that, you need to connect Git with GitHub in order for vscode to send the updates from vscode, and here are the steps on how to upload your modified version of my website on to GitHub:

---

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Then create an account by clicking the button that says: "sign up", or if you have a GitHub account, then click the button that says: "sign-in", or "login".
3. Then connect vscode with GitHub, and connect Git with GitHub.
4. Initialize the old, or new version of my website that you have downloaded by typing the command: `git init`, or initialize it by going into vscode, and clicking the source control icon, then click the button that says: "initialize this folder".
5. Create an account for Git by typing these commands:
   - `git config --global user.name "[Your Username]"`
   - replace "[Your Username]" with your actual username.
   - `git config --global user.email "[Your Email Address]"`
   - replace "[Your Email Address]" with your actual email address.
6. Open CMD, or the vscode terminal, then type in: `git add index.html`
7. Open CMD, or the vscode terminal, and run the command: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
   - replace "Your commit message" with your actual commit message (eg, INITIAL COMMIT MESSAGE).
8. Open CMD, or the vscode terminal, and type in: `git remote add origin Remote_URL`
   - replace "Remote_URL" with the correct URL to your GitHub repository in order to connect your modified version of my website from your computer on to GitHub.
9. Open CMD, or the vscode terminal, and type in: `git push origin branch_name`
   - replace "branch_name" with your actual branch name.
10. If you don't want to push your modified version of my website using the CLI, then click the source control icon, then click on the button that says: "Commit". Or click the checkmark icon which is this:

    ![checkmark](images/checkmark.png)

11. Once you have commit your modified, or new files, and folders, then add your GitHub repository by opening GITLENS: REMOTES, then click the plus icon to add a remote, then choose your GitHub repository
12. Once you have add your GitHub repository/remote repository, then click the button that says: "Sync changes", then it will push the changes you have made on to GitHub
13. Use the .gitignore file to ignore the files, and folders you don't want to add, or commit
14. Open your GitHub repository, and see if the changes you have made is now on GitHub.

And there you go! Now, your modified version of my website is now on GitHub without cloning it on your computer. (But I will still recommend cloning the repository).

## Update: Update: Here's the download to the source code ZIP file:

[Eltus website 1.1.0](https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.0.zip)
