                        repository, so you can customize this clone repository as you like. Since it is not connected to
                        the original repository. And btw here's the full git clone command:</p>
                    <code>git clone https://github.com/eltus/test-website</code>

                        users folder. Because CMD and PowerShell set the default folder as your current user folder you
                        are using inside the users folder, or the system32 folder depending on opening CMD, or
                        PowerShell, normally, or as an admin (A.K.A administrator). So if you wan't to clone this

                        <li>Go to the top of the folder location, for example:</li>

                        <li>Copy this command from the "Update: I have just realized that you can just clone the

                    <code>git clone https://github.com/eltus/test-website</code>

                            the explorer, search, source control, and run and debug icons).</li>
                        <li>Search those 11 extensions from part 3 of "How to install" section</li>
                        <li>Click on those 11 extensions. (Or 1 if you are searching them one-by-one)</li>
                        <li>Then click on the blue "install" button.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>And now you have those 11 extensions installed. You can also install those 11 extensions on the

                        <li>Repeat the same steps from "Update: Here's how to install the vscode extensions from part 1,
                            and 3!" section. (Step 4, 5, and 6, but the blue install button becomes the big green
                            install button! The only thing that is changed are the size, and color)</li>
                        <li>When you click the big green "install" button, the website says that the extension will be
                            opened on vscode, but it needs your permission to open it, click yes, then it will open the
                            extension and install it (I think)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>And now, you have those 11 extension installed from vscode itself, and the vscode extension
