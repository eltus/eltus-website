        <h1>A 9-years old boy who is intrested in programming</h1>
        <p>Coding this website since February 20th 2024. I create YouTube videos that have gained hundreds of views, but
            I only have 137 subscribers, so subscribe!</p>

        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hello, my name is Eltus Tanggal! You might know me as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eltusYT"
                target="_blank">Eltus
                tanggal</a> online, or "the boy who speaks English" from East Manggarai Timur. I have a YouTube channel
            judging by my name, and I have made videos that have gained hundreds of views, but I only have 137
            subscribers, so
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eltusYT?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">support me by subscribing to
                my channel</a>
            (and follow me on Instagram). I like web dev, python and C# (I am only a beginner at web dev, and don't know
            python, and C#). Because I like that I can use packages to develop programs, and games in python! And I like
            C# because it is fast, and I like developing programs with the .EXE file type. (I don't know python, and C#,
            so I mainly use ChatGPT/Google Gemini to develop these projects, but I will learn python, and C#).
        </p>
        <p>I sometimes extend my website outside from my channel. That's why I have been uploading less on my channel
            lately, and I have been doing some stuff lately, so that's why I have been uploading less on my channel
            lately, again. And also, if you are confused with the word, "tanggal". It means "date" in Indonesia, so my
            name is technically Eltus Date in English. But I will list all the things about me that you didn't know, but
            that's for another section!</p>

        <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>So, my first inspiration was from YouTubers, and when I saw all the success, and fun they are having, I
            decided to start my own YouTube channel, and I upload every single topic I could find from YouTube. My first
            video was... <a href="https://youtu.be/LUUl6mzWCYg?si=-Mec77w0SEsVwrqY" target="_blank">music video about
                piglin song by systemzee and zamination and w labs std.</a> This was my first video ever, and this video
            is about me dancing while playing the <a href="https://youtu.be/Pa5Ti_tR0hE?si=N4Ss0lI67lVbHowm"
                target="_blank">Piglin Rap</a> and my dancing moves were horrible, and I truly hated my dance moves, and
            if you wan't to check the video, then click the video title colored text that I have put in, the colored
            text have the video title on it, and click it, and you can play the video on YouTube. And I got inspiration from Coding with Lewis, and the official vscode YouTube channel. The first programming language I use was HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and since I don't know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to use ChatGPT/Google Gemini/Talk AI for generating all of my code since I didn't know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The first AI model I used for generating all of my code was talk AI, talk AI is just like ChatGPT, but doesn't need you to sign-up or login, and you can only ask it 30 questions, and talk AI can generate images, but I think the website doesn't work anymore. Then we have ChatGPT, so I use the real ChatGPT to generate all of my code, and I have been using it for a long time, but then I switched to Google Gemini, then we have Google Gemini, so I when Google Gemini was introduced to me, I immediately open Google Gemini to test it, and I really liked it, then I switched from ChatGPT to Google Gemini.</p>

                    <h2>Why did I create this website:</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I created this website just for experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And I originally have a page called: "experiments" where I would experiment HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but when I add new things on to the website like the projects page, documents page, and more, I decided to rename my website to eltus website, so it will be seen as my personal website, and the original name for my website was test website, and the main file name was: "index.html", but the name was not index.html at the time, it was: "test_website.html", and even the main file was named test website too, but with an underscore, and the file type was html, but the style.css, and script.js files were named: "website_style.css", and "website_script.js". The names were similar, but with "website" at the start, and an underscore, and in the past, I usually store my website (A.K.A. Test website) in a folder called: "tests", and I am not lying, and I prove it to you by checking my README.md file on my GitHub repo, and seeing my first ever video, and you can see that there is a folder called: "tests", and that folder includes the test-website folder which contains all the files for my test website, and I originally was going to add a ZIP file that contains the source code of my website, but then I scrapped it, and then I added the ZIP file to my website, then delete it, and using the releases feature on GitHub, and I also deleted the experiment.html file since I didn't use it, and only use it just for experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I was originally going to add an about page, but then scrapped it because I was originally going to add a section for all the deleted files from my website, then I saw inspiration from coding with lewis' about page, so I created a new page, and now we are here with my about page created, and I also have this page called: "languages.html", and this page is for people who doesn't understand English, and I created a folder called: "languages" along with a sub-folder called: "Indonesian", or "indonesian", and in this sub-folder, I just copy, and paste the files, and ask ChatGPT to translate me all of them to Indonesian, but then I discovered the translate attribute, and the translate attribute is just for the browser translation features, for example, if I set it to "no", then the browser will not be able to translate the page, but if I set it to: "yes", then the browser will be able to translate the page, and I discovered the translate attribute from this post from daily.dev called: "21 HTML Tips You Must Know", and that's where I discovered the translate attribute, and the details, and summary tags, and more, and I recommend you signing-up to daily.dev, then search that post, then read it, and you might discover new things that makes HTML way easier.
