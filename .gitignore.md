This is a fake .gitignore file. Because this is just a README file for the .gitignore file that I have ingnored using the .gitignore file, so the file won't appear on the repository, and please remove the .md name from the end of this fake .gitignore file and remove everything in this file including the text, if you wan't to customize the repository by cloning it, or forking it, then remove the text from this file, and remove the .md name at the end of the file name, and if you don't wan't to do all of that, then you can create your own .gitignore file by opening CMD on the folder you wan't to add your .gitignore file, then type:

type > .gitignore
And this command will create a .gitignore file at the folder you open CMD, or you could just type:

echo > .gitignore
And this command will also create a .gitignore file, but I recommed using the echo command to generate the .gitignore file.
