        <h2>Update: I have just realized that you can just clone the repository, and if you don't know,
            follow these steps:</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Open CMD (A.K.A Command prompt)</li>
            <li>And type in "git clone" with the repository URL</li>
            <code>git clone</code>
            <li>Then click enter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And now, you have the repository on your computer, and since this is just a clone of the
            repository, so you can customize this clone repository as you like. Since it is not connected to
            the original repository. And btw here's the full git clone command:</p>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/eltus/test-website</code>
        <p>Copy this command to CMD, PowerShell, or the terminal, and click enter.</p>
        <h2>Warning!: Please use this command on CMD, PowerShell, or the terminal on a folder, or else, the
            repository will be cloned to the system32, or the current user folder you are using inside the
            users folder. Because CMD and PowerShell set the default folder as your current user folder you
            are using inside the users folder, or the system32 folder depending on opening CMD, or
            PowerShell, normally, or as an admin (A.K.A administrator). So if you wan't to clone this
            repository, then follow these steps:</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Open CMD, PowerShell, or the terminal on a folder you wan't to clone the repository</li>
            <li>Go to the top of the folder location, for example:</li>
            <img src="pointing.png" alt="jpg">
            <p>In this example, my mouse is pointing at something.</p>
            <li>Click it with your mouse</li>
            <li>Type in "CMD"</li>
            <li>And then, click enter.</li>
            <p>Now, this will open a CMD window</p>
            <li>Copy this command from the "Update: I have just realized that you can just clone the
                repository, and if you don't know, follow these steps:" section, or copy this command: (it's
                the same command from the first "Update" section)</li>
        </ol>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/eltus/test-website</code>
        <p>Now, you have the cloned repository on the folder, you wan't the repository to be
            cloned, instead of the current user folder you are using inside the users folder, or the
            system32 folder.</p>
        <h2>Update: Here's how to install the vscode extensions from part 1, and 3!</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Open vscode, or install vscode if you haven't already</li>
            <li>Look to the left sidebar, for example:</li>
            <img src="left_sidebar.png" alt="Left sidebar">
            <p>In this example, my mouse is on the left sidebar.</p>
            <li>Click the 4 grouped squares icon (A.K.A the extensions icon), under the 4 other icons (A.K.A
                the explorer, search, source control, and run and debug icons).</li>
            <li>Search those 11 extensions from part 3 of "How to install" section</li>
            <li>Click on those 11 extensions. (Or 1 if you are searching them one-by-one)</li>
            <li>Then click on the blue "install" button.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>And now you have those 11 extensions installed. You can also install those 11 extensions on the
            vscode extension marketplace, and here's how you do it:</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your browser, and search "vscode extension marketplace"</li>
            <li>Click the first link that appeared</li>
            <li>Repeat the same steps from "Update: Here's how to install the vscode extensions from part 1,
                and 3!" section. (Step 4, 5, and 6, but the blue install button becomes the big green
                install button! The only thing that is changed are the size, and color)</li>
            <li>When you click the big green "install" button, the website says that the extension will be
                opened on vscode, but it needs your permission to open it, click yes, then it will open the
                extension and install it (I think)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And now, you have those 11 extension installed from vscode itself, and the vscode extension
            marketplace.</p>
        <h2>Update: My website is now deployed! To access my website, click this link:</h2>
        <hr>
        <a href="https://eltus.github.io/test-website" target="_blank">Test website</a>
        <h2>Update: I just realized that you need git installed in order for the "git clone" command to
            work, so here's how you install git:</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your browser, and search, "git download" and click the first link that appeared, or
                click this link: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git download</a>
            </li>
            <li>Pick your OS (A.K.A Operating System). (It's either Windows, macOS, or Linux)</li>
            <li>Double click the installer</li>
            <li>Customize the installation as much as you like. (Not the entire installer tbh)</li>
            <li>Click the install button, once you have customize the installation. (Not the entire
                installer
                tbh, again)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, you have git installed, and be able to use the "git clone" command.</p>
        <h2>Update: Here's the Indonesian version of this page, if you don't know english:</h2>
        <hr>
        <a href="languages/indonesian/BACAAN.html"><button>Indonesian version</button></a>
        <h2>Update: I just realized that if you're new to programming, or do not know vscode, or do not know
            how to use vscode, then follow these steps on how to install and use vscode:</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your browser, and search, "vscode download", and click on the first link that appeared,
                or just click this link: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">vscode
                    download</a></li>
            <li>Pick your OS. (It's either Windows, macOS, or linux)</li>
            <li>Click on the installer file</li>
            <li>Customize the installation as much as you like. (Not the entire installation tbh)</li>
            <li>Then click install button, once you have customize the installation. (Not the entire
                installation tbh, again)</li>
            <li>Open vscode once the installation was completed</li>
            <li>Install the recommended extensions from the, "Part 2: Vscode extensions" section</li>
            <li>Clone the repository by opening CMD, PowerShell, or vscode's terminal, and type in:
                <code>git clone https://github.com/eltus/test-website</code> and enter.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>And now, you have the repository and vscode on your computer, and you can use the recommended
            vscode extensions to customize the cloned repository as you like.</p>
        <h2>Update: I just realized that you can just use the browser/online version of vscode, and here's
            how you do it:</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your browser, and copy this link: https://vscode.dev/, or click this link: <a
                    href="https://vscode.dev/" target="_blank">vscode.dev</a></li>
            <li>Click on the "Open folder" button, for example:</li>
            <img src="open_folder_button.png" alt="Open folder button">
            <p>In this image, my mouse is pointing at something, and you must click it with your mouse.</p>
            <li>Once you have clicked that button, then select a folder, and the website will send a message
                saying: "vscode.dev will be able to view files in New folder". Replace "New folder" with
                your actual folder name, or the repository's folder name (once you have cloned it ofc), and
                click view files, then it will say: "Do you trust the authors
                of this folder?". Click yes, but it will also ask you to save changes to the folder, so
                click, Save changes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now you'll be able to customize the repository without vscode installed on your computer. And
            check more info on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web" target="_blank">the
                vscode web
                documentation.</a></p>
        <h2>Warning!: The browser/online version of vscode is still at preview, so there might be some bugs,
            and glitches in the browser/online version of vscode, so it's highly recommended installing
            vscode, but once the browser/online version of vscode has moved to it's full release, then you
            can use the browser/online version of vscode, but you can still use it ofc, but there might be
            some bugs, and glitches, but you can still use it, even though it's still in preview.</h2>
