## Update: I have realized that you can just clone the repository, and if you don't know how to clone a repository follow these steps:
1. Open CMD.
2. And type "git clone" with the repository URL.
```
git clone
```
3. Then click enter.

And now you will have the repository on your system, and this repository is just a clone, so you can customize the cloned repository. Since it's not connected to the original repository. And also, here's the full "git clone" command:
```
git clone https://github.com/eltus/eltus-website
```
Copy this command and paste it to command prompt, or terminal, and click enter.

## Waring!: Please use this command on command prompt on a folder, or else the repository clone will be on the current user folder, on your users folder, or the system32 folder. Because that is the default folder when you open command prompt normally or as an administrator. So if you wanted to clone this repository, then open command prompt (A.K.A. CMD) on a folder, and here's how to open command prompt (A.K.A. CMD) on a folder.

1. Open the folder you wan't to clone the repository.
2. Go to the top of the folder and click the folder location, for example:

In this example, my mouse is pointing at something and you need to follow it.

## Part 2:
3. Now click with your mouse.
4. Type in CMD.
5. And enter.

Now, this will open a command prompt window.

6. Copy the command on top of the warning.

Now, you have the repository on a folder you wanted, and not on your current user folder on your users folder, or the system32 folder.
## Update: here's how to install all the vscode extensions from part 3!

1. Open vscode or install vscode if you haven't 
installed vscode yet.
2. Look to the left sidebar of vscode
3. Click the 4 grouped squares icon (A.K.A. The extensions icon) or press Ctrl, Shift and X. (A.K.A. Ctrl+Shift+X).
4. Search for those 3 extensions from part 3.
5. Click on those 3 extensions.
6. Click the green "install" button.

## And now you have those 3 extensions installed. You can also, do this using the vscode extension marketplace website. Here's how you do it.

1. Open your web browser and search: "vscode extension marketplace". Click on the first link that appeared.
2. Do the previous step from "Update: here's how to install all the vscode extensions from part 3!". Above (step 4, or number 4).
3. Same with step 5 or number 5.
4. Same with step 6 or number 6.
5. Now once you have clicked the "install" button, the website will ask you to open the extension in VS Code. Click yes.
6. Repeat step 6 from the previous section.

And now you know how to install those 3 vscode extensions using the "vscode extension marketplace" website.
## Update: I have removed the old video link for the "Go live" button. The unavailable one and replaced it with the new video link for the Go live button. The available one.
## Update: my test website is now on internet! To access my website. Click this link:
[Eltus website](https://eltus.github.io/eltus-website/)
## Update: I just realized that git must be installed in order for the, "git clone" command to work, so here are the steps on how to install git:
1. Open your browser and type this link, "https://git-scm.com/downloads", or just click this link: [Git download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Pick your OS for the installer file
3. Double click the EXE file
4. Customize the installation
5. Click the "install" button

Now you have Git installed on your computer
##  I just realized that if you are new to vscode or programming, then you don't know how to use, and maybe don't know how to install vscode, so here are the steps!
1. Go to this link: [vscode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Pick your OS! (It's either Windows, macOS, or linux)
3. Run the installer file, or just double click the installer file
4. Customize the installation. (Not the entire installation)
5. Click the "install" button to install vscode
6. Open vscode, and open the cloned repository folder
7. Install all the recommended extensions

Now, you can customize the cloned repository in vscode.
## Update: I just realized that you can just use the browser version of vscode, so here it is:
1. [click this link](https://vscode.dev/)
2. Click on the button that says "Open folder"
3. The website will give you permissions on opening, and editing the folder, or file, so click "View files" (for opening a folder), and "Save changes" (for editing the folder)
4. Clone the repository, and open the folder in the browser version of vscode.

And now, you're be able to use vscode without installing it on to your computer. And learn more about the browser version of vscode by going to the [vscode web documentation.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web)
## Warning!: The browser version of vscode is still at preview, so there might be some bugs, and glitches in the browser version of vscode, so it's highly recommended installing vscode, but once the browser version of vscode has moved to it's full release, then you can use the browser version of vscode, but you can still use it ofc, but there might be some bugs, and glitches, but you can still use it, even though it's still in preview.

## Second Warning!: Some extensions might not support the browser version of vscode, so it is recommended to install vscode, or use extensions that support the browser version of vscode, but the recommended extensions does not support the browser version of vscode yet, so it is still recommended installing vscode, or just use the browser version of vscode without extensions.
## Update: the browser version of vscode now supports programming languages, for example, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Including emmet too!  And prettier, GitLens, vscode-icons, and JavaScript (ES6) code snippets now support the browser version of vscode! Peacock, and Better Comments too!
## Update: download the batch/CMD, or PowerShell scripts if you want an easier method to clone the repository! Btw here's the downloads:
[Batch/CMD version]()
